unity-scope-click - Click Packages Scope for Unity
--------------------------------------------------

This scope shows the list of installed applications, and the list of 
applications available to download from the appstore webservice.
To authenticate downloads, this scope uses Ubuntu Online Accounts to
get credentials for the logged in user.
Since scopes are short lived, ubuntu-download-manager is used to do
the actual download.
