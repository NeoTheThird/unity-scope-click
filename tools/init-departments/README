This tool creates/updates the list of departments and package:department
mapping for installed apps, and stores it in a sqlite database file.
This db should then be put in the unity-scope-click-departmentsdb package
or manually copied to the location where click scope expects it to be, such
as ~/.cache/click-departments.db.

Usage:
init-departments DBFILE LOCALE1 [LOCALE2 ...]

for example:
init-departments click-departments.db "" pl_PL de_DE


To update the existing file with translations for a new language, copy
the existing data/departments.db file in the source tree to a new location,
run the tool to add translations to the new file, verify it is correct, and
then copy the database back to data/departments.db to create a merge proposal.
This will require an Internet connection, to retrieve the translations from
the server.

$ cp data/departments.db deparments.db-new
$ init-departments deparments.db-new zh_CN
$ sqlite3 departments.db-new "SELECT * FROM deptnames WHERE locale LIKE 'zh_CN';"
$ mv departments.db-new data/departments.db

THen you can commit, push, and propose the changes for merge into trunk.
