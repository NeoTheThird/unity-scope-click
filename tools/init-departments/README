This tool creates/updates the list of departments and package:department mapping
for currently installed apps, and stores it in a sqlite database file.
This db should then be copied to the location where click scope expects it to be (~/.cache/click-departments.db).

Usage:
init-departments DBFILE LOCALE1 [LOCALE2 ...]

for example:
init-departments click-departments.db "" pl_PL de_DE
